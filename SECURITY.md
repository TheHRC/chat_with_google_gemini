# Security Documentation for Chatbot with Google Gemini

## Security Improvements Implemented

### Phase 1: Critical Security Fixes (Completed)

1. **Secure Credential Management**
   - Added .env to .gitignore to prevent accidental exposure of API keys
   - Created .env.example as a template for required environment variables
   - Added validation for missing API keys with proper error handling
   - Implemented secure logging to avoid exposing sensitive information

2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Added validation for user inputs to prevent injection attacks
   - Implemented content filtering for potentially harmful patterns
   - Established input size limits to prevent DoS attacks
   - Added error handling with sanitized user-facing error messages


## Security Roadmap

### Phase 2: Core Security Improvements (Next Steps)

1. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Create custom error types for different security scenarios
   - Improve structured error logging with security context
   - Add more sophisticated error sanitization logic

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - Document update procedures for security patches
   - Create security audit process for third-party libraries

### Phase 3: Security Hardening

1. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive security logging with separate security log
   - Add monitoring for suspicious activity patterns
   - Create alert thresholds for anomalies

2. **Code Structure Improvements**
   - Refactor for better separation of concerns
   - Implement proper authentication for multi-user scenarios
   - Add request rate limiting

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing

1. **Security Documentation**
   - Expand incident response procedures
   - Add security testing guidelines for developers
   - Create security architecture document

2. **Security Testing**
   - Implement automated security tests
   - Perform penetration testing
   - Create fuzzing tests for input handling

## Security Best Practices

1. **API Key Management**
   - Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
   - Use environment variables for configuration
   - Rotate API keys regularly

2. **Input Validation**
   - Always validate user inputs before processing
   - Consider both syntax and semantic validation
   - Use proper content filtering

3. **Error Handling**
   - Log detailed errors internally but show generic errors to users
   - Include security context in logs
   - Monitor for error patterns that might indicate attacks
